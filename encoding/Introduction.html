    <h1>Welcome to the Encoding Task Experiment</h1>
    <p>Thank you for participating in our study. This experiment is designed to investigate the process of encoding in memory, focusing on a simple letter-to-number encoding task.</p>
    
    <h2>Experiment Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You will be presented with two letters: A and B</li>
        <li>A corresponds to the number 1, and B corresponds to the number 2</li>
        <li>The experiment consists of two rounds</li>
        <li>In each round, you will be shown only one of the two letters, selected at random</li>
        <li>Your task is to enter the correct numerical code for the letter shown</li>
        <li>The letter and the input field for the code will be presented on the same page</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reward System</h2>
    <p>You will be awarded Â£5 for correctly encoding the letter. While there are two rounds, payment will be based on your performance in only one randomly selected round.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pay close attention to the letter displayed on each round</li>
        <li>Enter the corresponding number (1 for A, 2 for B) in the provided input field</li>
        <li>Submit your answer</li>
        <li>Repeat for the second round</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your participation is valuable in helping us understand the cognitive processes involved in basic encoding tasks. If you have any questions, please ask the experimenter before beginning.</p>
